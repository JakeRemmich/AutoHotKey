# Corrected Test Instructions

## Step #3 - Corrected Version

**Option A: Using JavaScript fetch in Browser Console**

Action: In the Developer Console, run the following JavaScript code to get user information:

```javascript
// Get the access token from localStorage
const accessToken = localStorage.getItem('accessToken');
console.log('Access Token:', accessToken);

// Make the API request
fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/user', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log('User Data:', data);
})
.catch(error => {
  console.error('Error:', error);
});
```

**Option B: Using cURL in Terminal/Command Prompt (Not Browser Console)**

If you want to use cURL, you need to:
1. First get your access token by running this in the browser console:
```javascript
console.log('Access Token:', localStorage.getItem('accessToken'));
```
2. Copy the token value
3. Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows)
4. Run this cURL command (replace `<your_access_token>` with the actual token):
```bash
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:3000/api/user' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>'
```

Expected result: The response should include the user's ID, email, scriptsGenerated (which should be 0 for new users), limit (3 for free plan), and plan (which should be 'free' for new users).

**Why this fixes the problem:**
- The browser's JavaScript console can only execute JavaScript code, not shell commands like cURL
- By using the `fetch` API, we're using proper JavaScript syntax that the browser console can understand
- Alternatively, by running cURL in a proper terminal, we're using the correct environment for shell commands

The backend code is working correctly - the issue is simply that the user was trying to run a shell command in a JavaScript environment.
